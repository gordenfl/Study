        S - Situation
        When I working in the realtime online backend, I was tasked with implement a real-time event processing system for a game server that ended to track player actions and broadcast updates to nearby players. However, we had just switched to using Apache Kafka for event streaming, which I had never used before.

        T - Task
        My responsibility is to design and implement the producer and consumer logic using Kafka, and I had about a week to get it into staging, as this was a critical path for the combat system

        A - Action
        To implement it quickly, I break the learning process into several steps:
        1. I read the official Kafka document, and toke a short online course to understand key concepts like partitions, consumer groups, offsets and message delivery semantics.
        2. I set up a local Kafka test cluster using Docker and created sample producers and consumers in Python to explore how message flow worked.
        3. After that, I implement a prototype for player event broadcasting and used Kafka topic to separate different event type
        4. To avoid issues in production, I add metrics and retry logic to handle message delivery failures and used offset tracking to ensure exactly-once processing

        R - Result
        Within 5 days, I believed the event streaming pipeline and integrated it with our game logic. The system scaled well and we were able to support thousands of concurrent player with smooth event delivery. It also became the foundation for other feature like analytics and logging. My manager appreciated how fast I adapted and turned it into a reusable pattern
