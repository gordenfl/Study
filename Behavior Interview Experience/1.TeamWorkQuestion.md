# Question about Team Work

1. Tell me about a time you worked in a team.

* Game Development

    * S - Situation
    In the game project, I was part of a cross-function building a real-time multiplayer game server engine
    I connected with different group in the engineer team, Client Team, Tools Team, QA Team and designer team. We have tight deadline to deliver a working each week, because we need a alpha version each week. And one beta version each month.

    * T - Task
    My responsibility was to design and implement the backend engine. it's include the room system, real-time battlefield messaging, and data management module. I also need to keep the backend engine stable for each product and it's very import not only for released version but also in development env.

    * A - Action
    To keep the efficiency, I create a weekly sync meeting with Client, QA, Designer team. in that meeting we discuss all the task in this week we have planed. Find the most difficult part. to make priority list for all these tasks. All the API document I will generate automatically every day from my code. That will let our team can know what has changed with these API of both QA and Client team.
    On the technical side, I just using the Nvidia PhysicX Library, and integrate in our engine, provide the Physic validation function for each product.

    * R - Result
    As a result, High efficiency of my work during the whole process of the product development and keep all these functions we added are stable. The document are very useful for the other server developers.

* ShareCreators Product

    * S - Situation
    In the project ShareCreators we call it blueberry-ai, as a co-founder there is only one engineer it's me. and I need connection with product team and QA team. This is very tough at first.

    * T - Task
    I need implement the whole prototype of the product for each part, include User management, resource management, version control, and resource discuss function, share function etc. not only on the Server side but also on the client.

    * A - Action
    At first I need to make clear of each design detail of this product and sometimes I need to discuss to designer with my opinion. because there are some tech limitation. I need read a lot of document of the 3rd library. to make test at first then embedded into our project.

    * R - Result
    As a result, 3 month passed, I finished all the functions of our product. and we can have fully demo of our product with Investors. Then we can hire more engineers after we got more investment.

2. Describe a time you had a conflict with a coworker. How did you handle it? 解决冲突

* Game Development 模块划分, 分开vs合并
    * S - Situation
    In the project of Game Produce. I was working with another backend engineer on designing the Module of the fighting and Matchmaking service.

    * T - Task
    He thinks that We should merge them into one process, just using different API to run different logic. But I think we should separate two of module into two process. It will have less dependency each other.

    * A - Action
    I suggested we should reduce the dependency for each of the feature in the product, because It is possible for designer add new feature into system or change something.
    During this session, we just have a discuss meeting, we express each of the point of view. I make sure to actively listen to his reason without any interrupting. In the End, we agree to separate tow of these functions into tow process.

    * R - Result
    This system design help us reduce the module dependency. The structure of our code look clear and less with chaos. The conflict actually increase our collaboration. Late we co-design a fighting system. It gives me growth in the communication.

* Game Development 2 协议选择 一个UDP 和TCP
    * S - Situation
    In the project of game product, I was working with another backend engineer on designing the battlefield. That teammate and I had a disagreement on the choosing of  protocol for different function in the battlefield
    在游戏产品开发的时候, 我和另外一个后端程序员一起工作 去设计一个战场. 另外那个程序员在选在协议方面和我有不同意见
    * T - Task
    I believed something time-sensitive action - like player movement and bullet path, should using UDP for speed and ignore the package loss.
    However, my the other backend engineer thinks that will be very complex. we just using tcp, it's simple to implement all of that.
    I 觉得有些数据是时间敏感的, 就像用户移动,弹道等信息, 这个需要用到UDP, 速度快,也不怕丢包
    但是我的同事觉得这样会提升很多代码的复杂度, 过去管理一个TCP fd, 现在还要管理udp的fd, 让代码难以维护
    * A - Action:
    To resolve this conflict, I suggest we list all the network dependence function and group them by reliability vs latency
    I created a table that compared user case:
        * movement, fire, ===> latency is more important
        * Player login, item pickup, damage  ====> reliability is more important

    then we build two small test scene one is only using TCP, another follow my suggestion, movement and fire using UDP. Then my demo is much better then his.
    为了解决这个不一致 我建议我们列出了所有功能对网络 可性度 和 延迟的重要性:
        我们觉得movement fire 对 延迟 更重要
        一般的逻辑像用户登录, 物品产生, damage 这种逻辑对 可信度 更重要
    然后我们做了两个不同的 test case, one is using TCP totally, 另一个是我所建议的,移动和开火用UDP, 其他的用TCP, 然后再体验上我的demo更好一些.
    * R - Result
    After we compare the test result. we got agreement that follow my strategy
        * UDP for frequent but non-critical updates
        * TCP for reliable game state changes
    It's related with the core of the game, so I think we need thinking more about that.
    通过自后的协商,我们觉得用我的方案会比较好一些,虽然代码增加了复杂度,但是对于用户体验的提升是值得的.
    所以 UDP就用来做一个 latency 要求高, 但是non-critical 的数据传输
    TCP用做可性度高但是latency 要求不是很高的数据传输.
    所以我觉得在产品基础上我们应该想得更加仔细.

* Share Creators

    * S - Situation
    In the project of Share Creators. After I finished demo of the product. We want to extend and optimize the whole system. We hired several engineers join into our team. We discuss how can we do next step.

    * T - Task
    This product need face huge data management not only in the database but also in the filesystem because there are a lot of Art resource in the product env. I suggestion build our product based on the demo. But there is a engineer think the demo has a lot of limitation. we need to implement the code with Java Spring boot, That's more professional and have more library can support more function.

    * A - Action
    I tole him this product do not have so much time to spend on the rework. He gives me another demo what he has done. and There are a lot of function is what we need but in the demo we just implement as a very simple one. And for the distribution function, my version can not achieve that. If we need to change to support that, it will take so much time.

    * R - Result
    After the discuss and demo analysis, we decide to change the technical structure of our product. Python version of our server just be a demo to description the requirement. I think I learned a lot from this discuss. And that engineer made a lot of contribution in the new version.

3. How do you handle feedback from teammates? 如何处理别人的feedback, 总结起来应该用事实说话不应该吵架.处理multi-thread, 不应该用Threading,而是应该用async

* Game Product
    * S - Situation
    In the game product development, I was responsible for implement the Matchmaking logic on the backend. we using Python + Redis. I had optimized the code because the speed by using a asyncio not using Threading.

    * T - Task
    After I submit the code for review, one of my teammates suggested that my design was low efficient. all the logic are in the one thread. It can not using multi-core of CPU, waster resource.
    * A - Action
    At first I was argue with other team members and I told them that asyncio is much better then Multi-Thread. because the GIL is locked in the basic layer. Later I think that's not good to argue with our team member. I need give them a fact to prove I am right.
    So Later I write two demos. One is using Threading to deal some logic, another one is using asyncio to deal the same logic. compare two of them, the result proved I am right.
    I tole them the logic about asyncio and Threading. Why in Python GIL is so low efficient.
    * R - Result
    As a result. All the team think I give them very good example and the code become very faster than before.

4. Describe a situation where you had to work with someone difficult. 工作中遇到一些困难如何处理,就是处理多了解别人的处境,帮助别人

* Game Product
    * S - Situation
    In the Game product development, I was collaborating with a senior engineer on the client side with the function of real-time combat sync. we had to optimize the network protocol design -- how to serialized and transfer actions data of player. 
    * T - Task
    The engineer using client-controlled timestamp model from syncing event. I strongly believe it would have some security issue and state chaos under pool network env. He avoid my ideal during our discussion.  
    * A - Action
    I decide to make a demo to let him notice the problem. I just make a test of his implementation, output all the vectors and clock drift. through these data let him know that way would not stable. Then I ask him why you still choose this way, he tole me that, It does not have so much time to pass on this task. He worry his performance in the team.
    So next step I agree with his mode, implement server-driven model without that problem.
    * R - Result
    After testing He agree with my server-driven model was more stable. and merged it into production. More importantly , that conversation help us build trust. In future project we collaborated better.
