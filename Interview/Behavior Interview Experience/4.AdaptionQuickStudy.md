# Adaption and Quick Study

1. Describe a time you had to learn a new technology quickly.

* Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly in order to succeed.

    * Game Product
        S - Situation
        When I working in the realtime online backend, I was tasked with implement a real-time event processing system for a game server that ended to track player actions and broadcast updates to nearby players. However, we had just switched to using Apache Kafka for event streaming, which I had never used before.

        T - Task
        My responsibility is to design and implement the producer and consumer logic using Kafka, and I had about a week to get it into staging, as this was a critical path for the combat system

        A - Action
        To implement it quickly, I break the learning process into several steps:
        1. I read the official Kafka document, and toke a short online course to understand key concepts like partitions, consumer groups, offsets and message delivery semantics.
        2. I set up a local Kafka test cluster using Docker and created sample producers and consumers in Python to explore how message flow worked.
        3. After that, I implement a prototype for player event broadcasting and used Kafka topic to separate different event type
        4. To avoid issues in production, I add metrics and retry logic to handle message delivery failures and used offset tracking to ensure exactly-once processing

        R - Result
        Within 5 days, I believed the event streaming pipeline and integrated it with our game logic. The system scaled well and we were able to support thousands of concurrent player with smooth event delivery. It also became the foundation for other feature like analytics and logging. My manager appreciated how fast I adapted and turned it into a reusable pattern

    * Share Creators
        S - Situation
        Share Creators Product, At first I implement with Python and Vue3. Later we switch into the Java sprint boot. At that time, I have no experience with Java and Spring Boot my Background is C++ and Python.

        T - Task
        My task was to fix performance issues in one of the core microservice that handled user authentication and data access. It has latency spikes and occasionally caused timeouts under load. I needed to quickly become productive in Spring Boot to debug and solve this problem.

        A - Action
        To promote up quickly:
        1. I spend two full days to study spring boot's architecture that include dependency injection and the annotation-driven configuration model
        2. I followed hands-on tutorials and build a minimal spring boot project oto understand how controllers services, and repositories interact.
        3. I read the official documents and profiled the actual production service using Spring Actuator, JVM profiling tools and Thread Dumps to analyze performance bottlenecks
        4. I discovered that the system was using blocking I/O for external API calls, which caused thread starvation under high concurrency
        5. I proposed and implemented a fix using WebClient from Spring's reactive stack to introduce Non-blocking I/O, and added proper connection polling and timeouts.

        R - Result
        After deploying the fix, the average response time dropped 60%, and timeout were disappear under the stress testing.
        More importantly, I became comfortable working in the Spring Boot with just one week, and continue to contribute to our project.
        The team appreciated my ability to quickly learning and resolved key problems.
