# Leadership and Proactive (Senior is most important)

1. Tell me about a time you took ownership of a problem.

* Game product
    S - Situation
    on our online game platform, we received increasing reports that some player were losing progress after disconnections - especially during high-action events like boss fights. This was during player trust and retention.
    T - Task
    Althrough this wasn't part of my assigned sprint. I took investigate the issue because i knew it affected core player experience.
    My goal is to find the root cause, and fix it. because it's very important of the whole server
    A - Action
    I began by analyzing session of log and found that in high-latency conditions. our server was not consistently saving mid-combat progress before the player disconnect. The autosave logic was triggered only during graceful exits which does not support the force disconnects
    What I did:
    * Took ownership of the task and open a tracking tick with a technical write-up and propose fix.
    * Refactored the player state manager to triggers not on the logic layer it should on the network layer.
    * I add the timer to trigger the save logic not only while user quit the game.
    * I add the integration tests to our CI and make a lot of test by myself.

    R - Result
    Then the team leader want to find another person to resolved that problem. I told him I have already fixed it. After I make the code review. All other team member thinks it's the right way and I have done that without any task assignment. The team lead give's a prise.

* Share Creators
    S - Situation
    At Sharecreators , I was leading the backend group of our resource management and collaboration platform for game studio. During one release version, our team received a complains from key users that uploading large 3D assets sometimes failed silently. At first we can not tracing where is the error occurred. That issue affected client trust and blocked artists in their workflow. Fixing that problem is very urgent.
    T - Task
    As the leader of this engineer team. I felt responsible not only just fix the issue, but we need to improve the reliability and user experience around file uploads. Even though the issue  is related to the server the client and infrastructure. I decide to take full ownership and org engineer to resolve this problem.

    A - Action
    I just started to analysis logs not only for the resource mgr side but also the storage module. I found that uploads were failing on large files due to inconsistent chunk handling during network interrupt. we lake the logic of retry and progress report.
    What I did:
    * Refactor the upload logic in the resource module support chunked resumable uploads. using pre-signed URLs and server-side session token
    * Improved the backend API to return detailed progress and error message. then the frontend can display.
    * Discuss with frontend engineer to update the UI with real-time progress bar, give the user feedback
    * Add monitoring for update failure rate. so we could detect issues in the future.

    R - Result
    Upload success rate for large file increated from -80% to 98% and user experience promoted a lot.
    More important things are works helped us create a useful culture in our team that is we can not throw the issue to other people, we need have more motivation to help resolve more hard issue.

2. Describe a project you led from start to finish.

* Game Product
    S - Situation
    In our online multiplayer game project, we does not have the responsible for checking the game logic, but it lacked the true physics simulation engine. All the Collision, movements ahd hit detections were either simplify or all the logic are in client. leading our system logic has a lot of conflict.
    T - Target
    The target is integrate the PhyX into our engine, because base layer of Unity 3D is using PhyX as well. It must implement in C++ in our server engine. support rigid body, collision detection etc.

    A - Action
    I led this project end-to-end, and I implement a lot of important function as well.
    * Research and Evaluation
    At beginning, I only can use PhyX does not know the core logic in that. This time I need to make clear all about PhyX, detail, API, even source code. I read a lot of the document and code. then make a demo of that. Through the performance testing, we find the PhyX is very hight efficient than I think. so we decide to make a implement in our product.
    * Architecture * integration
    I refactor the entity component system on server to support the physic component layer. I defined a clear interface for position update, force application, collision response
    * Sync logic
    I add Python script bindings to allow game designers to define physical behavior (knock back, gravity zone etc.) while keeping core simulation deterministic and authoritative.
    * Performance
    To Keep server tick time under 50ms:
        1. batched collision checks we use quad-tree
        2. Parallelized non-overlapping region
        3. Profile and tuned the memory layout of physical objects
    * Testing and deployment
    I wrote unit tests and ran large-scale simulation test with bots ro ensure stability. And also communicate with QA to let them know the which part is need to be test more careful.

    R - Result
    After PhyX embedded in our engine:
    * We saw a 100% reduction in client desync report during combat
    * Cheating with "Ghost movement" was disappeared
    * User retention improved in our product
    * Our product can support more feature design related with Physic system.

* Share Creators
    S - Situation
    In Sharecreators we faced a huge problem which is the most important part of our product is manually tagging, searching, and organizing massive number of art resource, which as low efficient and easy to have error.

    T - Task
    As a project leader, I proposed and drove the integration of AI-powered asset recognition and search feature into the platform.
    The goal was to embed machine learning into our product let automatically analyze, tag and classify image and 3D files.

    A - Action
    I led the project from idea to release across several key phases
    
    * Model Evaluation
        research pre-trained version models. and evaluated their performance on our dataset of game textures, UI elements and 3D renders.
    * Backend integration
        Designed a scalable pipeline to extract feature from assets during upload
        Python service integrated with Celery task queue deployed with Docker to separate with our basic system.

    R - Result
    The AI system we spend 8 weeks. 90% art resource has been auto-tagged
    Our active client teams give us hight positive feedback.
    Promote our platform's competitive then other product.

3. Tell me about a time you went beyond your job responsibilities.

* Game project
    S - Situation
    Multi-player online game, my responsible is mainly implement the server network and IO, include the Python interpreter integration.
    In an inner test, we found the system depend on client the physic system to sync data each other. It will bring a lot of logic error.

    T - Task
    This is not in my responsible, when I found this is the weakness of our server side. So I suggest that we should embedded Physic System into our server, let server to make decision of the logic. It will increase the user experience.

    A - Action
    This is what I have done:
        1. make a assasment of different physic engine, include Box2D, Bullet, finally we choose the PhyX, let this one embedded into server C++.
        2. Refactor our server logic, build the physic component based on PhyX. let all the entity become a rigi body.
        3. Write the Python interface by calling Python interpreter API
        4. To keep performance,  I just choose make partition scheduling mechanism to perform physical calc only in hot spots.

    R - Result
    After publish, the experience promote a lot and server can truly hode the physical logic in the game logic. and the sync delay of PvP mode dropped.

4. How do you mentor junior engineers?

* Share Creators
    S - Situation
    At sharecreatos, as a team leader for out backend and infrastructure development, I worked closely with several junior engineer who were new to Kafka or unfamiliar with scalable backend system design
    T - Task
    As a part of my technical responsibilities, I make it a priority to mentor junior engineers. helping them grow their confidence, write production-quality code, and contribute meaningfully to our project
    A - Action
    I used several method:
        1. Code Reviews
        I don't only approve or reject. I will explain why it's not good from the performance and structure of whole project. I will always give them a simple or short pair programming session to help them
        2. Structured Onboarding
        I created a onboarding docs for the junior engineers. It will let all of them practice step by step. the document include the API, REST AWS integration and distribute system design.
        3. Growth-Oriented Tasks
        I give the ownership to the jour engineer (simple functions), let them make design how to implement that. then I will give them some suggestion, let them know why the new one are better.
        4. Feedback & Encouragement
        Weekly 1v1 discuss not only their tasks but also their learning goal, give them encourage.

    R - Result
    I can see the clear growth:
    One junior engineer finished a full asset management module. and finished some optimize task.
    Team become efficiency. Junior employee can join discussion have more confident.
