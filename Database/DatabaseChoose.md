# Database Choose principle

RDS can support complex relationship between data models, but NoSQL cannot.
If the system has complex relationship with each entity, please choose RDS if not just using NoSQL

Why Choose NoSQL, because NoSQL has very strong high efficient to write and read, and it can be extend easy. That's why the NoSQL are alway used by the Huge project.
